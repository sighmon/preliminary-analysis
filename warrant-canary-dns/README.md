# Store a warrant canary in DNS

Inspired by the deprecated [EFF Canary Watch](https://www.canarywatch.org) service.

**Assumptions**
WC = Warrant Canary

**Problem**: Allow a machine readable warrant canary to remain globally cached (TTLs that match WC period) and therefore available even if your website is taken down or attacked.

**Solution**: Host your WC in a DNS TXT record.

**Issues to resolve**
* Due to TTL of DNS record and older response may be supplied, DNS queries should always be performed ignoring TTL or work on a 1/2th of WC validity period for TTL and have a full DNS recheck performed if the WC has expired.
* DNS TXT records wrap every 255 characters in quotes.
* Warrant Canary needs to be base64â€™d first, then process only the 255 characters between the quote marks.
* Host a DNS creation service that lets users point to their warrant canary file and generates a subdomain and a DNS TXT record for them. i.e. [simonsigrecom.canarycache.org](https://simonsigrecom.canarycache.org)
* Crowdfund the web service that allows users to add their WC files, and shows a diff history to highlight changes to the wording of canaries.
